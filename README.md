### Abstract
The Finite State Machine (FSM) Interactive Learning Website is a modern and user-friendly online platform designed to assist Computer Science students in comprehending the fundamental concepts of [Finite State Machines](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). Utilizing cutting-edge technologies such as Vue.js, TypeScript, CSS, and HTML, this interactive web application aims to provide an intuitive and engaging learning experience for users of all levels of expertise. The website is thoughtfully optimized for **Search Engine Optimization** (SEO), offers **Progressive Web App** (PWA) support, and boasts a responsive design, making it accessible on various devices and platforms.

### Introduction
Finite State Machines (FSMs) play a pivotal role in computer science, serving as a foundational model for the design and analysis of systems with discrete and sequential behavior. However, grasping the intricacies of FSMs can prove challenging for students and learners in the field. This project seeks to bridge the knowledge gap by offering a web-based platform that allows users to interact with FSMs, create their own state machines, and evaluate their behavior in real-time simulations.
